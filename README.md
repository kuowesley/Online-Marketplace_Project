about core features "Like/Diske a transaction: Allows the user to Rate Their Order and Leave Comment"
We comdine the features "Like/Diske" and "Rate Their Order", useing rating scale from 1 to 5 stars to indicate
they like the item or not.
We discussed this with the professor and he agree with it.

We have 3 registered accounts: user1, user2, user3 with the same password "K@123456"and 11 items in the mongoDB.
Each account have different items listing.

There is one more page did not mention in the video.
In the individual item page, there is a "click here" link which can direct to another page and show
all the comments and ratings about that seller.

extra feature:
"A map that shows the trading place for the buyer"
it is in the individual item page, it will use the location field of the item to show a google map

"Generate the item list page based on userâ€™s recent browsing history"
it is in the home page, if the user login an account and watched some item, 
it will show the browser history of items on the home page, just make users easier to see what they were looking
